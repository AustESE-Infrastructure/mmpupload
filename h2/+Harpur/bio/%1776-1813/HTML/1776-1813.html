<p>Joseph Harpur, the father of Charles Harpur, was born in 1776 at Kinsale, Munster, a picturesque port in the South of Ireland. He had 'pale skin, light brown hair and hazel eyes and was five foot four inches tall'. At around 1800 he was convicted of highway robbery, depriving, along with others, Thomas Comber on the Kings Highway of 60 pounds of bacon valued at 2 guineas, 4 gallons of yeast, a golden guinea and nine shillings and nine pence. He was sentenced to death, which was commuted to transportation because he could read and write. He arrived at Sydney Cove on the 22nd of November 1800 on the Royal Admiral. Initially he was assigned to John Macarthur and became his overseer. In Sydney he met his future wife Sarah Chidley. Sarah was born in 1786 in the small village of West Bagborough, Somerset, England. In August 1806 she was transported to Australia for larceny on the Alexander 1. They must have started living together probably in 1807, when Joseph got a job as a town clerk at Parramatta. She bore him two children before Charles: Elizabeth (1808) at Windsor, and Joseph Jehoshapat (1810) at Parramatta. In January of 1809 both she and Joseph witnessed the marriage of William and Catherine Davis at Parramatta. After receiving a 'ticket of leave' (a kind of parole linked to a local area) Joseph was appointed by Governor Macquarie as Master of the Public Charity School in Sydney on the 19th of June 1811, the salary for which in 1819 was &pound;100 per annum.</p>
