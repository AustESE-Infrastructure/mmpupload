<p>On the 27th of March Charles and his brother Joseph were sent to investigate a report that the head, skin and entrails of a sheep had been discovered in a paddock belonging to Mr Durham. They immediately recognised it as belonging to their father's flock, a large and rugged individual they had called 'the Bear'. It was probably Joseph, who was then 17 (Charles being only 14) who gave evidence to the Supreme Criminal Court, at Sydney on Aug 13, corroborating his father's story. Those accused of the crime were Patrick Goodman, and his accessories Bryan Spalding, Charles Walsh and Mary Walsh. Goodman, when asked where the meat came from by Mary Walsh replied: 'the devil mind him, he can well afford it', meaning Joseph Harpur. The prisoners were all found guilty. Sheep-stealing was taken very seriously in the young colony. Governor Macquarie had proclaimed in 1817 that the stealing of even one sheep owned by the Crown, or aiding in its theft, was a capital offence, without recourse to any form of mitigation or pardon. However, given that the sheep was privately owned, the convicted might receive a lesser sentence such as 100 lashes, or a custodial sentence with hard labour, although death by hanging was more usual. It must have been a very shaking experience for the two young boys. The accused appealed, and when tried a second time by the Supreme Criminal Court in November they were all acquitted by the jury except Goodman, although the judge admonished the other defendants for being, as he suspected, involved in the crime. Goodman is not listed in New South Wales in the 1828 census, but neither was Charles Walsh, nor Bryan Spalding.</p>
<p>In the same year Joseph Harpur, along with Thomas Arndell, let 15-30 acre allotments of unimproved forest land for development for farming at Moroota, 17 miles from Windsor. This seems to have been a measure to raise money.</p>
