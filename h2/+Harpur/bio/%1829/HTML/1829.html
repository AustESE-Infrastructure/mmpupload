<p>On the 5th of October Joseph Harpur was appointed a member, representing Windsor, of the Wesleyan Auxilliary Missionary Society of New South Wales, which had an annual budget of more than 50,000 pounds.</p>
<p>In late 1829 Joseph Harpur was forced to sell his Marootta Farm of 211 acres. In 1827 he had attempted to lease land at Marootta, but he seems to have fallen on hard times. An outstanding debt of &pound;100 is mentioned as owing to 'Cooper and Levey', 'unless this execution be previously satisfied'. Also sold was the house in Windsor, including all the furniture, and the land of 4 roods, 'on which have been erected in Macquarie street, Windsor, a Messuage or Tenement of 4 rooms, a stable, granary and couch house'. This must have been all he owned. Charles would have been just 16 years of age.</p>
